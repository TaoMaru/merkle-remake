# merkle-remake
Remake of an existing website design from the ground up

contents: 01-remake - holds index.html, styles.css, 
main.js, and assets folder

assets holds all pictures used on webpage

Ver01: main.js handles styling of main eye catching
content container (directly below header). This section
contains a carousel, which ver01 has as a loop with
timeout to update the background image from an array
of image src's. 

This will be changed in Ver02 to separate containers that 
toggle between hidden/shown, each with a separate 
text headline and background image.
